# InvraNet's Dotfiles
This is the Windows dotfiles. If you are looking for Linux dots, or macOS please go to the branch tree and find it.

## My Workflow
    - Neovim
    - VS Code
    - Spotify
    - Spicetify (To make spotify better)
    - Windows Terminal
    - Steam
    - Epic Games Launcher
    - Ubisoft

A lot of these things will be scripts, or sometimes a config.
